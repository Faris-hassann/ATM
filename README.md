# ATM
Creating a console-based ATM software in C++ that handles cash transactions, password resets, and utilizes pointers without object-oriented programming involves a structured approach focused on functions, efficient memory management, and user interaction within the console environment.

The ATM software starts with a user-friendly interface, displaying options such as withdrawing money, checking account balance, resetting passwords, or exiting the system. C++ output functions manage the display while input functions gather user choices, ensuring seamless interaction.

Account information, including account balances and user passwords, is stored using pointers and dynamic memory allocation in C++. Functions manage memory allocation, allowing users to input and store their account details securely.

The software offers options for withdrawing money from the account. Functions handle withdrawal requests, utilizing pointers to manage account balances and deduct the requested amount from the available funds. Efficient algorithms ensure secure and accurate transactions.

Cash flow within the ATM is managed using pointers to simulate the available cash in different denominations. Functions handle cash replenishment and deduction during withdrawals, updating the available cash based on the transaction amount.

Password reset functionality is included for user security. Functions allow users to reset their passwords by verifying current credentials, accepting a new password, and updating the stored password using pointers for memory manipulation.

Error handling functions manage unexpected inputs or invalid actions during the ATM session. Robust validation ensures secure and error-free transactions, guiding users through the process.

Efficient memory management using pointers ensures optimal utilization of resources while securely storing and managing account details and transaction data.

The console-based visual interface provides users with clear instructions, prompts, and transaction confirmations. Output functions display account balances, transaction details, and success messages, enhancing user experience within the console environment.

Security features, such as limited login attempts or encryption of sensitive information, can be implemented through functions and pointers to enhance data protection.

Code optimization through modular functions, pointer arithmetic, and efficient algorithms ensures smooth and responsive ATM functionality within the console environment, focusing on user convenience and secure transactions.

In summary, this console-based ATM software in C++ utilizes pointers and functions to manage cash transactions, account balances, password resets, and user interaction within a secure and efficient environment. The software emphasizes memory management, error handling, and clear user interface design to provide a seamless ATM experience without object-oriented programming.
